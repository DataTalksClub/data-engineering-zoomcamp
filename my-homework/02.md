1. Within the execution for Yellow Taxi data for the year 2020 and month 12: what is the uncompressed file size (i.e. the output file yellow_tripdata_2020-12.csv of the extract task)?
I got the following value by going to the Google Cloud Platform Dashboard > Cloud Storage > Buckets > select my bucket > `yellow_tripdata_2020-12.csv`.
**128.3 MB**

2. What is the rendered value of the variable file when the inputs taxi is set to green, year is set to 2020, and month is set to 04 during execution?
Since you are rendering an input the output of that call to render should be a string with the values passed to the original input. the format of which looks like `{{inputs.taxi}}_tripdata_{{inputs.year}}-{{inputs.month}}.csv` and when rendereed with `green`, `2020`, `04` it becomes:
**`green_tripdata_2020-04.csv`**

3. How many rows are there for the Yellow Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?
I got the following value by going to the Google Cloud Platform Dashboard > Big Query > Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM `PROJECT_ID.zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata`
WHERE TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(tpep_pickup_datetime, year) = TIMESTAMP("2020-01-01");
```
**24,648,499**

4. How many rows are there for the Green Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?
I got the following value by going to the Google Cloud Platform Dashboard > Big Query > Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM `PROJECT_ID.zoomcamp.green_tripdata`
WHERE TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(lpep_pickup_datetime, YEAR) = TIMESTAMP("2020-01-01");
```
**1,734,051**

5. How many rows are there for the Yellow Taxi data for the March 2021 CSV file?
I got the following value by going to the Google Cloud Platform Dashboard > Big Query > Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM `PROJECT_ID.zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata`
WHERE TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(tpep_pickup_datetime, MONTH) = TIMESTAMP("2021-03-01");
```

6. How would you configure the timezone to New York in a Schedule trigger?
From the [Kestra Docs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/triggers/schedule-trigger)
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: daily
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@daily"
    timezone: America/New_York
```
**Add a timezone property set to America/New_York in the Schedule trigger configuration**
