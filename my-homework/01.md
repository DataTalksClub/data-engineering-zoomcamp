2. Given the following docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

**postgres:5432**

This will be the port and name of the postgres __container__. The container_name is given as postgres while the port is the second number under ports:

container_name: postgres
ports:
  - '5433:5432' ## Eg. - 'host port:container port'


```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin  

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

3. During the period of October 1st 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st 2019 (exclusive), how many trips, respectively, happened:
  - Up to 1 mile
  - In between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive),
  - In between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive),
  - In between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive),
  - Over 10 miles

**104,838; 199,013; 109,645; 27,688; 35,202**

```sql
WITH trip_distances AS (
SELECT trip_distance
	, CASE WHEN trip_distance <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS up_to_one
	, CASE WHEN trip_distance > 1 AND trip_distance <= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS one_and_three
	, CASE WHEN trip_distance > 3 AND trip_distance <= 7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS three_and_seven
	, CASE WHEN trip_distance > 7 AND trip_distance <= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS seven_and_ten
	, CASE WHEN trip_distance > 10.0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS over_ten
FROM green_taxi_data_hw
)

SELECT
	  SUM(up_to_one) AS total_up_to_one
	, SUM(one_and_three) AS total_one_and_three
	, SUM(three_and_seven) AS total_three_and_seven
	, SUM(seven_and_ten) AS total_seven_and_ten
	, SUM(over_ten) AS total_over_ten
FROM trip_distances;

```
| total_up_to_one | total_one_and_three | total_three_and_seven | total_seven_and_ten | total_over_ten |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 104838          | 199013              | 109645                | 27688               | 35202          |


4. Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Use the pick up time for your calculations.
    - Tip: For every day, we only care about one single trip with the longest distance.


**2019-10-31**

```sql
SELECT CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) AS DAY
FROM green_taxi_data_hw
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
| day        |
|------------|
| 2019-10-31 |

5. Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in total_amount (across all trips) for 2019-10-18?
    - Consider only lpep_pickup_datetime when filtering by date.

**East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights**

```sql
SELECT z."Zone" AS pickup_locations
FROM green_taxi_data_hw g
JOIN zones z ON g."PULocationID" = z."LocationID"
WHERE CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-10-18'
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 13000; 
```
| pickup_locations    |
|---------------------|
| East Harlem North   |
| East Harlem South   |
| Morningside Heights |

6. For the passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone named "East Harlem North" which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
    - Note: it's tip , not trip
    - We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

** **
```sql
SELECT zd."Zone" AS dropoff_zone
    , MAX(g.tip_amount) AS max_tip
FROM green_taxi_data_hw g
JOIN zones AS zp ON g."PULocationID" = zp."LocationID"
JOIN zones AS zd ON g."DOLocationID" = zd."LocationID"
WHERE zp."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
  AND g.lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
  AND g.lpep_pickup_datetime < '2019-11-01'
GROUP BY zd."Zone"
ORDER BY max_tip DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
| dropoff_zone | max_tip |
|--------------|---------|
| JFK Airport  | 87.3    |

7. Which of the following sequences, respectively, describes the workflow for:
(init, apply, destroy)
**terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy**
