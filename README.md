> Three months might seem like a long time, but the growth and learning during this period are truly remarkable. It was a great experience with a lot of learning, connecting with like-minded people from all around the world, and having fun. I must admit, this was really hard. But the feeling of accomplishment and learning made it all worthwhile. And I would do it again!
