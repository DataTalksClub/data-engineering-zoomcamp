Welcome to your new dbt project!

### How to run this project 
#### Prerequisites
We will build a project using dbt and a bigquery database, but any other database of your choice could be used. 
By this stage of the course you should have already: 
- A running warehouse (BigQuery) 
- A set of running pipelines ingesting the project dataset: [Taxi Rides NY dataset](dataset.md)

You will need to create a dbt cloud account using [this link](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/) and connect to your warehouse [following these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-setting-up-bigquery-oauth). 

I used one database 'production' with a schema for local development 'dbt_victoria_mola' and another schema 'master' for production deployment. 

_Optional_: If you feel more comfortable developing locally you could use a local installation of dbt as well. You can follow the [official dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) or use a docker image from oficial [dbt repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/)

### About the project
This project is based in [dbt starter project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-starter-project) (generated by running `dbt init`)
Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test

A project includes the following files: 
- dbt_project.yml: file used to configure the dbt project. If you are using dbt locally, make sure the profile here matches the one setup during installation in ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
- *.yml files under folders models, data, macros: documentation files
- csv files in the data folder: these will be our sources, files described above
- Files inside folder models: The sql files contain the scripts to run our models, this will cover staging, core and a datamarts models. At the end, these models will follow this structure:

#### Execution
After having installed the required tools and cloning this repo, execute the following commnads: 

1. Change into the project's directory from the command line: `$ cd [..]/taxi_rides_ny`
2. Load the CSVs into the database. This materializes the CSVs as tables in your target schema: `$ dbt seed`
3. Run the models: `$ dbt run`
4. Test your data: `$ dbt test`
_Alternative: use `$ dbt build` to execute with one command the 3 steps above together_
5. Generate documentation for the project: `$ dbt docs generate`
6. View the documentation for the project, this step should open the documentation page on a webserver, but it can also be accessed from  http://localhost:8080 : `$ dbt docs serve`
