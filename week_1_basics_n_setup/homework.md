## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment 
and practice with terraform and SQL

## Question 1. Google Cloud SDK

Install Google Cloud SDK. What's the version you have? 

To get the version, run `gcloud --version`

```
gcloud --version
Google Cloud SDK 368.0.0
bq 2.0.72
core 2022.01.07
gsutil 5.6
```

## Google Cloud account 

Create an account in Google Cloud and create a project.

## Question 2. Terraform 

Now install terraform and go to the terraform directory (`week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform`)

After that, run

* `terraform init`
* `terraform plan`
* `terraform apply` 

Apply the plan and copy the output to the form

`terraform plan`
```
                                                            main
var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: dataeng-zoomcamp


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions
are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "trips_data_all"
      + delete_contents_on_destroy = false
      + etag                       = (known after apply)
      + id                         = (known after apply)
      + last_modified_time         = (known after apply)
      + location                   = "europe-west6"
      + project                    = "dataeng-zoomcamp"
      + self_link                  = (known after apply)

      + access {

          + special_group  = (known after apply)
          + user_by_email  = (known after apply)

          + view {
              + dataset_id = (known after apply)
              + project_id = (known after apply)
              + table_id   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

  # google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "data-lake-bucket" {
      + force_destroy               = true
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "EUROPE-WEST6"
      + name                        = "dtc_data_lake_dataeng-zoomcamp"
      + project                     = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = true
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "Delete"
            }

          + condition {
              + age                   = 30
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + versioning {
          + enabled = true
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

`terraform apply`

```
terraform apply                                                            main

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creation complete after 2s [id=dtc_data_lake_dataeng-zoomcamp]
google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creation complete after 4s [id=projects/dataeng-zoomcamp/datasets/trips_data_all]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```


## Prepare Postgres 

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos

We'll use the yellow taxi trips from January 2021:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv
```

Download this data and put it to Postgres

## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were there on January 15?

## Question 4. Average

Find the largest tip for each day. 
On which day it was the largest tip in January?

(note: it's not a typo, it's "tip", not "trip")

## Question 5. Most popular destination

What was the most popular destination for passengers picked up 
in central park on January 14?

Enter the district name (not id)

## Question 6. 

What's the pickup-dropoff pair with the largest 
average price for a ride (calculated based on `total_amount`)?


## Submitting the solutions

Form for sumitting (TBA)

Deadline: 24 January, 17:00 CET
