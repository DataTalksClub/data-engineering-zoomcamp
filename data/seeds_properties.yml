    description: >
      Taxi Zones roughly based on NYC Department of City Planning's Neighborhood
      Tabulation Areas (NTAs) and are meant to approximate neighborhoods, so you can see which
      neighborhood a passenger was picked up in, and which neighborhood they were dropped off in. 
      Includes associated service_zone (EWR, Boro Zone, Yellow Zone)
