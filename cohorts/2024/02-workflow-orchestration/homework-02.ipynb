    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal will be to construct an ETL pipeline that loads the data, performs some transformations, and writes the data to a database (and Google Cloud!).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new pipeline, call it `green_taxi_etl`\n",
    "- Add a data loader block and use Pandas to read data for the final quarter of 2020 (months `10`, `11`, `12`).\n",
    "  - You can use the same datatypes and date parsing methods shown in the course.\n",
    "  - `BONUS`: load the final three months using a for loop and `pd.concat`\n",
    "- Add a transformer block and perform the following:\n",
    "  - Remove rows where the passenger count is equal to 0 _or_ the trip distance is equal to zero.\n",
    "  - Create a new column `lpep_pickup_date` by converting `lpep_pickup_datetime` to a date.\n",
    "  - Rename columns in Camel Case to Snake Case, e.g. `VendorID` to `vendor_id`.\n",
    "  - Add three assertions:\n",
    "    - `vendor_id` is one of the existing values in the column (currently)\n",
    "    - `passenger_count` is greater than 0\n",
    "    - `trip_distance` is greater than 0\n",
    "- Using a Postgres data exporter (SQL or Python), write the dataset to a table called `green_taxi` in a schema `mage`. Replace the table if it already exists.\n",
    "- Write your data as Parquet files to a bucket in GCP, partioned by `lpep_pickup_date`. Use the `pyarrow` library!\n",
    "- Schedule your pipeline to run daily at 5AM UTC.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Question 4. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the existing values of `VendorID` in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1, 2, or 3\n",
    "* 1 or 2\n",
    "* 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "* 1\n",
