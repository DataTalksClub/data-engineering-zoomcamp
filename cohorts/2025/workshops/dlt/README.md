Welcome to this hands-on workshop, where you'll learn to build efficient and scalable data ingestion pipelines.

### **What will you learn in this workshop?**  

In this workshop, you‚Äôll learn the core skills required to build and manage data pipelines:  
- **How to build robust, scalable, and self-maintaining pipelines**.  
- **Best practices**, like built-in data governance, for ensuring clean and reliable data flows.  
- **Incremental loading techniques** to refresh data quickly and cost-effectively.  
- **How to build a Data Lake** with dlt.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to build data pipelines like a senior data engineer ‚Äî quickly, concisely, and with best practices baked in.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Teacher

Welcome to the DataTalks.Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp the data ingestion workshop!

I'm Violetta Mishechkina, Solutions Engineer at dltHub. üëã
- I‚Äôve been working in the data field since 2018, with a background in machine learning.
- I started as a Data Scientist, training ML models and neural networks.
- Over time, I realized that in production, hitting the highest RMSE isn‚Äôt as important as model size, infrastructure, and data quality - so I transitioned into MLOps.
- A year ago, I joined dltHub‚Äôs Customer Success team and discovered dlt, a Python library that automates 90% of tedious data engineering tasks.
- Now, I work closely with customers and partners to help them integrate and optimize dlt in production.
- I also collaborate with our development team as the voice of the customer, ensuring our product meets real-world data engineering needs.
- My experience across ML, MLOps, and data engineering gives me a practical, hands-on perspective on solving data challenges.

## Next steps

As you are learning the various concepts of data engineering, 
consider creating a portfolio project that will further your own knowledge.

By demonstrating the ability to deliver end to end, you will have an easier time finding your first role. 
This will help regardless of whether your hiring manager reviews your project, largely because you will have a better 
understanding and will be able to talk the talk.

Here are some example projects that others did with dlt:
