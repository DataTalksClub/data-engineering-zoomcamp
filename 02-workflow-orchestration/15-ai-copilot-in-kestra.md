# AI Copilot in Kestra

Kestra's AI Copilot is specifically designed to generate and modify Kestra flows with full context about the latest plugins, workflow syntax, and best practices.


*Copilot’s advantage is contextual assistance: it drafts within Kestra’s flow model while keeping review and execution explicit.*

## Setup AI Copilot
Before using AI Copilot, you need to configure Gemini API access in your Kestra instance.

**Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key**

1. Visit Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key (keep it secure!)

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit API keys to Git. Always use environment variables or Kestra's KV Store.

**Step 2: Configure Kestra AI Copilot**

Add the following to your Kestra configuration. You can do this by modifying your `docker-compose.yml` file from 2.2:

```yaml
services:
  kestra:
    environment:
      KESTRA_CONFIGURATION: |
        kestra:
          ai:
            type: gemini
            gemini:
              model-name: gemini-2.5-flash
              api-key: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}
```

Then restart Kestra:
```bash
cd 02-workflow-orchestration/docker
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
docker compose up -d
```

## Exercise: ChatGPT vs AI Copilot Comparison
**Objective:** Learn why context engineering matters.

1. **Open Kestra UI** at http://localhost:8080
2. **Create a new flow** and open the Code editor panel
3. **Click the AI Copilot button** (sparkle icon ✨) in the top-right corner
4. **Enter the same exact prompt** we used with ChatGPT:
   ```
   Create a Kestra flow that loads NYC taxi data from a CSV file to BigQuery. The flow should extract data, upload to GCS, and load to BigQuery.
   ```
5. **Compare the outputs:**
   - ✅ Copilot generates executable, working YAML
   - ✅ Copilot uses correct plugin types and properties
   - ✅ Copilot follows current Kestra best practices

**Key Learning:** Context matters! AI Copilot has access to current Kestra documentation, generating Kestra flows better than a generic ChatGPT assistant.
