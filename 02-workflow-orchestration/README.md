# Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

Welcome to Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp! 🚀😤 This week, we'll be covering workflow orchestration with Mage.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. ✨

This week, you'll learn how to use the Mage platform to author and share _magical_ data pipelines. This will all be covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

## 📕 Course Resources

### 2.2.1 - 📯 Intro to Orchestration

In this section, we'll cover the basics of workflow orchestration. We'll discuss what it is, why it's important, and how it can be used to build data pipelines.

- 2.2.1a - [What is Orchestration?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li8-MWHhTbo&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb)

### 2.2.2 - 🧙‍♂️ Intro to Mage

In this section, we'll introduce the Mage platform. We'll cover what makes Mage different from other orchestrators, the fundamental concepts behind Mage, and how to get started. To cap it off, we'll spin Mage up via Docker 🐳 and run a simple pipeline.

### 2.2.3 - 🐘 ETL: API to Postgres

Hooray! Mage is up and running. Now, let's build a _real_ pipeline. In this section, we'll build a simple ETL pipeline that loads data from an API into a Postgres database. Our database will be built using Docker— it will be running locally, but it's the same as if it were running in the cloud.

### 2.2.4 - 🤓 ETL: API to GCS

Ok, so we've written data _locally_ to a database, but what about the cloud? In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of using Mage to extract, transform, and load data from an API to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). 

We'll cover both writing _partitioned_ and _unpartitioned_ data to GCS and discuss _why_ you might want to do one over the other. Many data teams start with extracting data from a source and writing it to a data lake _before_ loading it to a structured data source, like a database.

### 2.2.5 - 🔍 ETL: GCS to BigQuery

Now that we've written data to GCS, let's load it into BigQuery. In this section, we'll walk through the process of using Mage to load our data from GCS to BigQuery. This closely mirrors a very common data engineering workflow: loading data from a data lake into a data warehouse.

### 2.2.6 - 👨‍💻 Parameterized Execution

By now you're familiar with building pipelines, but what about adding parameters? In this video, we'll discuss some built-in runtime variables that exist in Mage and show you how to define your own! We'll also cover how to use these variables to parameterize your pipelines. Finally, we'll talk about what it means to *backfill* a pipeline and how to do it in Mage.

### 2.2.7 - 🤖 Deployment (Optional)

In this section, we'll cover deploying Mage using Terraform and Google Cloud. This section is optional— it's not *necessary* to learn Mage, but it might be helpful if you're interested in creating a fully deployed project. If you're using Mage in your final project, you'll need to deploy it to the cloud.
