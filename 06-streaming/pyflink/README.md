# Apache Flink Training
Apache Flink Streaming Pipelines

## :pushpin: Getting started 

### :whale: Installations

To run this repo, the following components will need to be installed:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#installation-scenarios) (required)
3. Make (recommended) -- see below
    - On most Linux distributions and macOS, `make` is typically pre-installed by default. To check if `make` is installed on your system, you can run the `make --version` command in your terminal or command prompt. If it's installed, it will display the version information. 
    - Otherwise, you can try following the instructions below, or you can just copy+paste the commands from the `Makefile` into your terminal or command prompt and run manually.

        ```bash
        # On Ubuntu or Debian:
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential

        # On CentOS or Fedora:
        sudo dnf install make

        # On macOS:
        xcode-select --install

        # On windows:
        choco install make # uses Chocolatey, https://chocolatey.org/install
        ```

### :computer: Local setup

Make sure you're in the `pyflick` folder:

```bash
cd 06-streaming/pyflink
```

## :boom: Running the pipeline

1. Build the Docker image and deploy the services in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the PostgreSQL database and Flink cluster. This will (should) also create the sink table, `processed_events`, where Flink will write the Kafka messages to.

    ```bash
    make up

    #// if you dont have make, you can run:
    # docker compose up --build --remove-orphans  -d
    ```

    **:star: Wait until the Flink UI is running at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/) before proceeding to the next step.** _Note the first time you build the Docker image it can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. Future builds should only take a few second, assuming you haven't deleted the image since._

    :information_source: After the image is built, Docker will automatically start up the job manager and task manager services. This will take a minute or so. Check the container logs in Docker desktop and when you see the line below, you know you're good to move onto the next step.

    ```
    taskmanager Successful registration at resource manager akka.tcp://flink@jobmanager:6123/user/rpc/resourcemanager_* under registration id <id_number>
    ```

2. Now that the Flink cluster is up and running, it's time to finally run the PyFlink job! :smile:

    ```bash
    make job

    #// if you dont have make, you can run:
    # docker-compose exec jobmanager ./bin/flink run -py /opt/job/start_job.py -d
    ```

    After about a minute, you should see a prompt that the job's been submitted (e.g., `Job has been submitted with JobID <job_id_number>`). Now go back to the [Flink UI](http://localhost:8081/#/job/running) to see the job running! :tada:


3. When you're done, you can stop and/or clean up the Docker resources by running the commands below.

    ```bash
    make stop # to stop running services in docker compose
    make down # to stop and remove docker compose services
    make clean # to remove the docker container and dangling images
    ```

    :grey_exclamation: Note the `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory inside the PostgreSQL container is mounted to the `./postgres-data` directory on your local machine. This means the data will persist across container restarts or removals, so even if you stop/remove the container, you won't lose any data written within the container.

------

:information_source: To see all the make commands that're available and what they do, run:

```bash
make help
```

As of the time of writing this, the available commands are:

```bash

Usage:
  make <target>

Targets:
  help                 Show help with `make help`
  db-init              Builds and runs the PostgreSQL database service
  build                Builds the Flink base image with pyFlink and connectors installed
  up                   Builds the base Docker image and starts Flink cluster
  down                 Shuts down the Flink cluster
  job                  Submit the Flink job
  stop                 Stops all services in Docker compose
  start                Starts all services in Docker compose
  clean                Stops and removes the Docker container as well as images with tag `<none>`
  psql                 Runs psql to query containerized postgreSQL database in CLI
  postgres-die-mac     Removes mounted postgres data dir on local machine (mac users) and in Docker
  postgres-die-pc      Removes mounted postgres data dir on local machine (PC users) and in Docker
```
